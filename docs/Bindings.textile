This guide covers "Ruby amqp gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp v0.8.0 and later.



h2. Bindings in AMQP 0.9.1

Bindings are rules that exchanges use (among other things) to route messages to queues. To instruct an exchange E to route messages to a queue Q,
Q has to _be bound_ to E. Bindings may have an optional _routing key_ attribute used by some exchange types. The purpose of the routing key is to
selectively match only specific (matching) messages published to an exchange to the bound queue. In other words, the routing key acts like a filter.

Learn more about how bindings fit into the AMQP Model in the {file:docs/AMQP091ModelExplained.textile AMQP 0.9.1 Model Explained} documentation guide.

h2. Binding queues to exchanges

In order to receive messages, a queue needs to be bound to at least one exchange. Most of the time binding is explcit
(done by applications). To bind a queue to an exchange, use {AMQP::Queue#bind} where the argument passed can be
either an {AMQP::Exchange} instance or a string.

<pre>
<code>
queue.bind(exchange) do |bind_ok|
  puts "Just bound #{queue.name} to #{exchange.name}"
end
</code>
</pre>

Full example:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/998727.js"> </script>

The same example using a string without callback:

<pre>
<code>
queue.bind("amq.fanout")
</code>
</pre>

Full example:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/998729.js"> </script>


h2. Unbinding queues from exchanges

To unbind a queue from an exchange use {AMQP::Queue#unbind}:

<pre>
<code>
queue.unbind(exchange)
</code>
</pre>

Full example:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/998742.js"> </script>

Note that trying to unbind a queue from an exchange that the queue was never bound to will result in a
channel-level exception.
