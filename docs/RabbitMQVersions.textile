h1. amqp gem and RabbitMQ versions compatibility

h2. Using recent versions on Debian and Ubuntu

Ubuntu (even 10.10) and Debian both "ship with old RabbitMQ version":http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/rabbitmq-server,
that only supports AMQP protocol 0.8. amqp gem 0.8.0 and later *will not work with RabbitMQ versions
before 2.0.0*.

We strongly recommend that you use "RabbitMQ apt repository":http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian.html#apt that has recent versions of RabbitMQ.



h2. TLS (SSL) support

Note that "before 1.7.0, RabbitMQ did not support TLS":http://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html. In order to have TLS
support, RabbitMQ 1.7.0 requires

 * Erlang/OTP R13B or later
 * Erlang SSL 3.10 or later

and recommends using Erlang R141B that ships with Erlang SSL 4.0.1.
