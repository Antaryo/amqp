h1. Patterns and Use Cases


h2. About this guide

This guide explains typical messaging patterns and use cases. It only covers the most common scenarios. For comprehensive list
of messaging patterns, consult books on this subject, for example, "Enterprise Integration Patterns":http://www.eaipatterns.com.


h2. Covered versions

This guide covers "Ruby amqp gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp v0.8.0 and later.



h2. Introduction

Messaging patterns are a lot like object-oriented design patterns: they are generalized reusable solutions to specific problems. They are not
recipes, however, and their exact implementation may and will vary from application to application. Just like OO design patterns,
they can classified:

 * Message construction patterns describe form, content and purpose of messages.
 * Message routing patterns outline how messages can be directed from producers to consumers.
 * Message transformation patterns change message content or metadata.

There are other, more specialized group of messaging patterns that are out of scope of this guide.

This guide demonstrates implementation of several common routing patterns plus explains how built-in AMQP 0.9.1 features
can be used to implement message construction and message transformation patterns.

h2. Request/Reply pattern

h3. Description & Use cases

Request/Reply is a simple way of integration when one application issues a request and another application responds
to it. This pattern is often referred to as"Remote Procedure Call", even when it is not entirely correct. Request/Reply
pattern is a 1:1 communication pattern.

Some examples of Request/Reply pattern are:

 * The 1st application requests a document that the 2nd application generates or loads and returns.
 * End-user application issues a search request and another application returns results back.
 * One application requests a progress report from another application.

h3. AMQP-based implementation

Implementation of Request/Reply pattern on top of AMQP 0.9.1 involves two messages: a request (Req) and a response (Res).
Client app generates a request identifier and sets :message_id attribute on Req. Client also uses a server-named
exclusive queue to receive replies and thus sets :reply_to Req attribute to the name of that queue.

Server app uses a well-known queue name to receive requests and sets :correlation_id to :message_id of the original
request message (Req) to make it possible for the client to identify what request this reply is for.

h4. Request message attributes

<dl>
  <dt>:message_id</dt>
  <dd>Unique message identifier</dd>

  <dt>:reply_to</dt>
  <dd>Queue name server should send the response to</dd>
</dl>

h4. Response message attributes

<dl>
  <dt>:correlation_id</dt>
  <dd>Identifier of the original request message (set to request's :correlation_id)</dd>

  <dt>:routing_key</dt>
  <dd>Client's replies queue name (set to request's :reply_to)</dd>
</dl>



h3. Code example

h4. Client code

<pre>
<code>
require "amqp"

EventMachine.run do
  connection = AMQP.connect
  channel    = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)

  replies_queue = channel.queue("", :exclusive => true, :auto_delete => true)
  replies_queue.subscribe do |metadata, payload|
    puts "[response] Response for #{metadata.correlation_id}: #{payload.inspect}"
  end

  # request time from a peer every 3 seconds
  EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(3.0) do
    puts "[request] Sending a request..."
    channel.default_exchange.publish("get.time",
                                     :routing_key => "amqpgem.examples.services.time",
                                     :message_id  => Kernel.rand(10101010).to_s,
                                     :reply_to    => replies_queue.name,
                                     :immediate   => true)
  end


  Signal.trap("INT") { connection.close { EventMachine.stop } }
end
</code>
</pre>


h4. Server code

<pre>
<code>
require "amqp"

EventMachine.run do
  connection = AMQP.connect
  channel    = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)

  requests_queue = channel.queue("amqpgem.examples.services.time", :exclusive => true, :auto_delete => true)
  requests_queue.subscribe(:ack => true) do |metadata, payload|
    puts "[requests] Got a request #{metadata.message_id}. Sending a reply..."
    channel.default_exchange.publish(Time.now.to_s,
                                     :routing_key    => metadata.reply_to,
                                     :correlation_id => metadata.message_id,
                                     :immediate      => true,
                                     :mandatory      => true)

    metadata.ack
  end


  Signal.trap("INT") { connection.close { EventMachine.stop } }
end
</code>
</pre>

In the examples above messages are published with the :immediate attribute set. This is not necessary in all
cases: sometimes it is OK for requests to sit in the queue without active consumers. Replies, on the other hand,
assume an active consumer and existing replies queue, so if routing or immediate delivery do not succeed,
server application will log returned messages. More on this in the {file:docs/Exchanges.textile Working With Exchanges} guide.





h2. Command pattern

h3. Description & Use cases

Command pattern is very similar to Request/Reply, except that there is no reply and messages are typed. For example, most modern Web
applications have at least one "background task processor" that carries out a number of operations asynchronously,
without sending any responses back. Command pattern usually assumes 1:1 communication.

Some specific examples of Command pattern are:

 * Account termination in a Web app triggers information archiving (or deletion) that is done by a separate app "in the background".
 * After a document or profile update, a Web app sends out commands to a search indexer application.
 * Virtual machines control dashboard app sends virtual machine controller application a command to reboot.


h3. AMQP-based implementation

Implementation of Command pattern on top of AMQP 0.9.1 involves well-known durable queues. Application that issues the command
then can use default exchange to publish messages to well-known services directly. Request message :type attribute then indicates
command type and message body (or body and headers) carry additional information consumer needs to carry it out.

h4. Request message attributes

<dl>
  <dt>:type</dt>
  <dd>Message type, as a string. For example: gems.install or commands.shutdown</dd>
</dl>

h3. Code example

Consumer:

<pre>
<code>
require "rubygems"
require "amqp"
require "yaml"

t = Thread.new { EventMachine.run }
sleep(0.5)


connection = AMQP.connect
channel    = AMQP::Channel.new(connection, :auto_recovery => true)

channel.prefetch(1)

# Acknowledgements are good for letting the server know
# that the task is finished. If the consumer doesn't send
# the acknowledgement, then the task is considered to be unfinished
# and will be requeued when consumer closes AMQP connection (because of a crash, for example).
channel.queue("amqpgem.examples.patterns.command", :durable => true, :auto_delete => false).subscribe(:ack => true) do |metadata, payload|
  case metadata.type
  when "gems.install"
    data = YAML.load(payload)
    puts "[gems.install] Received a 'gems.install' request with #{data.inspect}"

    # just to demonstrate a realistic example
    shellout = "gem install #{data[:gem]} --version '#{data[:version]}'"
    puts "[gems.install] Executing #{shellout}"; system(shellout)
    puts "[gems.install] Done"
    puts
  else
    puts "[commands] Unknown command: #{metadata.type}"
  end

  # message is processed, acknowledge it so that broker discards it
  metadata.ack
end

puts "[boot] Ready. Will be publishing commands every 10 seconds."
Signal.trap("INT") { connection.close { EventMachine.stop } }
t.join
</code>
</pre>


Producer:

<pre>
<code>
require "amqp"
require "yaml"

t = Thread.new { EventMachine.run }
sleep(0.5)

connection = AMQP.connect
channel    = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)

# publish new commands every 3 seconds
EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(10.0) do
  puts "Publishing a command (gems.install)"
  payload = { :gem => "rack", :version => "~> 1.3.0" }.to_yaml

  channel.default_exchange.publish(payload,
                                   :type        => "gems.install",
                                   :routing_key => "amqpgem.examples.patterns.command")
end

puts "[boot] Ready"
Signal.trap("INT") { connection.close { EventMachine.stop } }
t.join
</code>
</pre>




h2. Event pattern

h3. Description & Use cases

Event pattern is a version of the Command pattern, but with 1 or more receivers (1:N communication).
The world we live in is full of events, so applications of this pattern are endless.

Some specific use cases of Event pattern are

 * Event logging (one application asks event collector to record certain event and possibly take action)
 * Event propagation in MMO games
 * Live sport score updates
 * Various "push notifications" for mobile applications
