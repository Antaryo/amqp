h2. About this guide

This guide is a quick tutorial that helps you to get started with AMQP 0.9.1 in general and amqp gem in particular.
It should take about 20 minutes to read and study provided code examples. This guide covers

 * Installing RabbitMQ, a mature popular implementation of multiple versions of AMQP protocol.
 * Installing amqp gem via "Rubygems":http://rubygems.org and "Bundler":http://gembundler.com.
 * Running a "Hello, world"-like code example, a simple demonstration of 1:1 communication.
 * Creating a "Twitter like" publish/subscribe example with 1 publisher and 4 subscribers, a case of 1:n communication.
 * Creating a topic routing example with 2 publishers and 8 subscribers, a case of n:m communication when subscribers only receive messages they are interested in.
